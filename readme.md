# Advent of Code 2020

## https://adventofcode.com/

I'm doing Advent of Code (and you should too)!

Every morning, I'll update this with the previous day's solution.

This code isn't perfect and it's not supposed to be -- it was fun to make and it works (some better than others).

### Running the Code

Every day follows the same template. Just run test.py and it should output the answer... not always in the same format (because sometimes I print it in the solution).
